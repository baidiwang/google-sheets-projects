# Why do NYC boroughs have different tree numbers?

As I’m also working on a project about NYC trees for interactive craft class, I did some research about trees in the city. What I found interesting is the difference between trees that per person has in NYC five boroughs. Depending on data provided from the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, Queens is the borough with the most trees. I want to find the reasons that caused the difference of trees in five boroughs. I assume the potential reasons might be related to median incomes and available spaces. So I also collected data about median income and parks numbers in five boroughs.

Data links:

-   [Trees numbers in five boroughs](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/)
-   [Population of five boroughs](<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-by-Boro ugh-1950-2040/xywu-7bv9/data>)
-   [Median Household income of five boroughs](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/NYC_Neighborhood_Economic_Profiles_2017.pdf)\\
-   [Parks lists of five boroughs](https://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/parks-list?boro=X)

Potential human sources:

-   Trees expert: An arborist, Samuel A. Bishop II, as I'm also doing a biography research assignment about him, so I could reach out to him to get professional knowledge of trees.
-   Here's the list of official people I could contact with:
    [New York City Department of Parks & Recreation](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/people)

Example(s) of a publication:

-   This is a super cool map done by MIT. It is very visual that it shows the areas covered by trees on a map while having a percentage showing the tress coverage rate. I’m thinking of making a map too, but I will focus on the reasons that caused the difference of trees areas in five boroughs.
